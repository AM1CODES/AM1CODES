### About MeðŸ‘‹
A Creative Machine Learning, Data Science enthusiast who loves to play around with data. That's the best i could introduce myself. I am a sophomore student currently pursuing B.Tech in CSE with specialization in AI and ML. I love to work with data and that is my primary domain of work as well but apart from that i am also into stuff like UI/UX. I also enjoy writing and publish blogs every now and then in which i share my learnings. I love to build stuff so you can see me at your next hackathon participating with my hacker group! </br>
Fun Fact : I am freelance film maker and editor as well and i love creating stuff!

Also, If you are someone who wants to get started with Machine Learning and Data science, me and my friends at elecTRON have built **OneStep** which is an educational platform thats an one stop solution for all your Data science and Machine learning needs and it's live right now! You can check it out [here](https://onestep-electron.github.io/) or you can just head to the repository below if you are feeling adventurous!

Currently, i am diving into the world of Deep learning by building some cool and unique projects. I am exploring more in UI/UX and product development as well on the side.
